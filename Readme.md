* (Q2) Report the running time of the copy command.
* Since I'm using Windows cmd, I need a workaround method, here it is calculated to be around 12 seconds but because I was typing as well, -6 seconds it is supposed to be around 5-6 seconds.

* (Q3) How do the two numbers compare? (The running times of copying the file through your program and the operating system.) Explain IN YOUR OWN WORDS why you see these results.

* (Q4) Does the program run after you change the default file system to HDFS? What is the error message, if any, that you get?

* (Q5) Use your program to test the following cases and record the running time for each case.

* (Q6) Test your program on two files, one file stored on the local file system, and another file stored on HDFS. Compare the running times of both tasks. What do you observe?
